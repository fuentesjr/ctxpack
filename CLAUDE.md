# CLAUDE.md — Claude Code adapter

**Read and follow [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).** It is the canonical operating
manual for this repo (project map, commands, conventions, failure modes,
quality bars, caution list, escalation). This file adds only what is
Claude-specific; if anything here seems to conflict with `AGENTS.md`,
`AGENTS.md` wins.

## Session bootstrap

- Fresh working sessions resume from `PROJECT_TRACKER.md` ("Resuming a
  session"): its "Next step: execution plan" is the work order.
- Tier 2 harness runs need a session started with
  `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` (the harness spawns unsandboxed
  subject sessions) — see `eval/tier2/RUNBOOK.md`. Never start the grid from
  a normal session; it will be refused by the permission classifier.

## Repo skills (in `.claude/skills/`, symlinked to canonical `.agents/skills/`)

| Skill | Use when |
|---|---|
| `codex-spec-pass` | Landing a spec pass via the Codex delegation loop (dispatch → background poll → session-side verify → `--resume` fix rounds) |
| `tier0-corpus-rescan` | Any compiler-behavior change, at the pass boundary — mandatory gate |
| `add-fixture-eval` | Any packet bug found — turn it into a Tier 1 YAML regression case, red-then-green |
| `extract-approach` | After **every** non-trivial solved problem, before moving on. A solution without its learning note in `docs/agent-learnings/` is unfinished work |

Edit skills only at their canonical `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` path —
the `.claude/skills/` entries are symlinks, and the rest of `.agents/skills/`
is a gitignored synced mirror you must not edit.

## Delegation model (Claude-specific)

Roles the main session coordinates. All of this is Claude Code harness
machinery — subagent types and the `--advisor` flag don't exist for Codex or
other agents, which is why it lives here and not in `AGENTS.md`.

Invariant across every profile below:

- **Orchestrator (this session).** Plans, coordinates, verifies, owns the
  "Proof before claiming success" bar below, and relays to the user.
  Subagents never talk to the user directly.
- **Judgment calls → the advisor**, configured at launch via
  `--advisor <model>` (currently `fable`). Guidance-only: it returns exactly
  one of a plan, a correction, or a stop signal — never a patch, never
  user-facing prose. It advises both a stuck writable worker (the built-in
  advisory pattern) and the orchestrator; the caller still owns the decision
  and the execution. Consult it on genuine forks or hard-to-reverse calls,
  not for things settleable from the code or sensible defaults.
- Verification gates (proof bar, Tier 0 rescan, commit/push rules) never
  vary by profile — only who implements does.

Escalation thresholds (two failed attempts, spec↔design conflicts, new deps,
etc.) are in `AGENTS.md` "Escalation rules" and apply to every role.

## Delegation profiles

Who implements is a per-work-order choice among named profiles. Selection
order: an explicit user instruction in-session > the profile named in the
tracker's "Next step: execution plan" > the default. **Default: `grok-loop`.**
State the active profile when starting implementation work.

| Profile | Implementer | When | Mechanics |
|---|---|---|---|
| `grok-loop` | Grok Build via the grok plugin | Default for heavy / spec-pass-sized implementation | Same loop shape as `codex-spec-pass` (dispatch → background poll → session-side verify → resume fix rounds), using the grok companion at `$(jq -r '.plugins["grok@grok"][0].installPath' ~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json)/scripts/grok-companion.mjs` (resolve via `installed_plugins.json`, not by picking a cache version dir — stale versions linger there) — `task --background --write [--resume]` / `status` / `result` / `cancel`. Forwarder agent: `grok:grok-rescue`. Always dispatch with the companion's own `--background` flag (same foreground-reap wedge risk as codex). |
| `codex-loop` | Codex via the codex plugin | Heavy implementation when Codex is preferred or grok is unavailable | `codex-spec-pass` skill + "Codex delegation notes" below. |
| `local-fleet` | Local writable subagents | Multi-role local work: recon/plan → implement → review/QA without an external delegate | `planner` / `helper-worker` → `coding-worker` (normal scope) or `fast-coding-worker` (small/mechanical) → `reviewer` / `qa-engineer` / `edge-case-analyst`. The `autobots` skill covers dispatch recipes. |
| `frugal` | `fast-coding-worker` + advisor | Small, well-scoped changes where cost matters more than depth | Cheap executor implements; blocking decisions route to the advisor (plan / correction / stop only); orchestrator verifies as usual. |

Why the loops call the companion scripts by path: the plugins expose no
orchestrator-usable alternative — their `status`/`result`/`cancel` commands
are `disable-model-invocation: true` (user-typed only), `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`
is unset in the main session, and the rescue forwarders are contractually
dispatch-only.

## Codex delegation notes (Claude-side mechanics)

The `codex:codex-rescue` agent is a one-shot forwarder. Poll from the main
session via the companion script at
`$(jq -r '.plugins["codex@openai-codex"][0].installPath' ~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json)/scripts/codex-companion.mjs`,
and always have the forwarder launch with the companion's own `--background`
flag — details and the wedged-run recovery playbook are in the
`codex-spec-pass` skill and `PROJECT_TRACKER.md` "Working process".

## Proof before claiming success

Do not say "done", "fixed", or "passing" without, in this session:

1. `bundle exec rake test` output pasted (must show `0 failures, 0 errors`).
2. The diff reviewed against the spec codes in scope, each named.
3. For packet bugs: the new eval case shown failing pre-fix.
4. For compiler-behavior changes: corpus re-scan result stated, or an explicit
   deferral note.
5. Anything unverified named as unverified.
